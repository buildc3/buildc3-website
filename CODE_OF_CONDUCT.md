- **Be patient and helpful** — Remember that everyone was a beginner once. Take time to explain concepts and provide constructive feedback.

- **Respect different perspectives** — Approach disagreements with curiosity rather than hostility. Seek to understand before being understood.

- **Focus on what's best for the community** — Make decisions that benefit the broader community, not just individual interests.

- **Document and teach** — Write clear documentation, share your learnings, and help improve how we teach engineering.
